Run as aforementioned step to thin image
Main driver functions shown as below, and the rest of detailed implementation of respective function, please check `utils.py` under this homework for more information.

```python
def do_thinnig():
    img_bin = img_binarize(img)
    
    row, col = (img_bin.shape)
    row, col = row // 8, col // 8
    res_final = np.zeros((row, col), np.int)
    
    for i in range(row):
        for j in range(col):
            res_final[i, j] = img_bin[8 * i, 8* j]
    
    step_cnt = 0
    while True:
        # use numpy copy to prevent from changing to same memory block
        res_old = res_final
        if id(res_old) == id(res_final):
            res_old = np.copy(res_final)
        
        res_ib = do_ib(res_final)
        res_mp = do_mp(res_ib)
        
        res_yokoi = do_yokoi(res_final)
        res_to_delete = (res_yokoi == 1) * 1
        
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if res_to_delete[i, j] == 1 and res_mp[i, j] == 1:
                    res_final[i, j] = 0
        
        save_name = 'lena_thinned_step' + str(step_cnt) + '.png'

        plt.imshow(res_final, cmap = 'gray')
        plt.show()
        step_cnt += 1
        
        if np.sum(res_old == res_final) == row * col:
